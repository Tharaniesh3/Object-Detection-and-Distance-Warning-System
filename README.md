# Object Detection and Distance Warning System

**Object Detection and Distance Warning System** is a Python-based application that uses TensorFlow and PyTorch to detect objects in real-time and issue warnings based on their distance from the user. This system is designed for applications requiring automated object monitoring and alerting.

## Features

- **Real-Time Object Detection:** Utilizes advanced machine learning models to detect objects in video feeds.
- **Distance Measurement:** Calculates the distance of detected objects from the user.
- **Warning Alerts:** Provides audio or visual warnings when objects are within a specified proximity.

## Installation

To set up the Object Detection and Distance Warning System locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/object-detection-distance-warning.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd object-detection-distance-warning
    ```

3. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Download and set up pre-trained models (if applicable). Instructions will be provided in the repository.

5. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

After starting the application, you can:

- Access real-time video feeds where objects are detected.
- Configure distance thresholds for warnings.
- Receive alerts when objects approach the set distance limits.
